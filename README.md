This app was designed to meet a specific need. The creator of allinonehighschool.com is planning to apply to the American Council on Education to have some of the site's free online courses qualify for college credit. This app will be used in conjunction with a particular course on the site. It presents multiple-choice quizzes and tests which are to be taken at systematic intervals throughout the course. There are 10 quizzes with 10 questions each, and once taken the student's scores are recorded for each. 

The app is built using React, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose.
